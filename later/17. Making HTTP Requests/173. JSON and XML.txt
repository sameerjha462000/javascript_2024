JSON -- JavaScript Object Notation
XML -- Extensible markup language

Both of them are formats to represent data. XML is parent language of HTML.

JSON is just a subset of usual JavaScript Object. JSON is just an object.
We can only have string as a key and we cannot have complicated JavaScript structures as value. For example,
We cannot have function as a value in a JSON.
